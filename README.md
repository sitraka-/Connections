> The details are not the details, they make the product, just as details make the architecture — the gauge of the wire, the selection of the wood, the finish of the castings — the connections,the connections, the connections.

Charles Eames quoted in Massey, A., _Interior Design of the 20th Century_, New York, Thames and Hudson, 1990, 145–62.

# BACKGROUND

When [Charles Eames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eames) said the above, he was alluding to the relationship between elements of design detailing in a piece of office furniture. On a bigger scale, he meant this as a metaphor for the process of design as a whole. 

The concept of **_connections_** is closely related to common theories of **_creativity_**, and is fundamental to the production of design work in particular. 

Design as a process is very much concerned with the location, formation or exploitation of connections. Connections between what? Connections between disciplines such as design and architecture, music and performance, philosophy and physics; connections between objects; connections between departments; connections between institutions; connections between people and machines; connections between markets and consumers; connections between individuals and environments, subjects and objects. 

The connections between individuals on a course such as MAID is one of the primary defining characteristics of your learning experience. Coming from such a vast range of backgrounds and cultures, you have much to learn from each other. In undertaking this project, you will create symbolic links between individuals that will come to represent your group in dynamic terms. 

The project is intended to get you to work together as a team to create something that represents your MAID cohort. But importantly, connections also function as an introduction to the workshops, where you will work with the technical staff who you will engage throughout the course. The project will make you familiar with the workshop working practices and the materials and processes available to you.

# BRIEF

You will be divided into groups, with each group assigned a number and a list of action verbs to choose from. The chain reaction will commence with Group 1, as they create a mechanism to trigger a second device crafted by Group 2, all while embodying and expressing the selected action verb. The sequence continues with Group 3 and beyond until the final member of the chain. The task involves crafting the mechanism using materials and processes available within the college workshops.

# RULES

1. Keep it simple, test it, test it and test it!

2. The overall effect should be a dynamic, kinetic sculpture that represents not only you as individuals, but also as a group 

3. It is your responsibility to liaise with the person before and the person after to achieve the required transition between each piece 

4. You will have to practice and experiment to get this right 

5. The basic principle of all of these mechanisms is that there is an object that stores potential energy (in a spring, through gravity…). This should require a small amount of energy to trigger it, it may ‘do something,’ before then triggering the next mechanism 

6. This is not an art project as such. Your mechanism should be robust, easily re-settable, well designed, and well made. 

7. Your design may not involve petrochemicals, liquids, fire, gas or explosives. Sorry! 

8. The most effective sections have some kind of delay mechanism that creates a pause and creates tension. The key is to engineer the right length of delay

9. You may want to include some sort of found object in your section. This will allow you to create a narrative around the object and what it is doing.

10. Your piece should not simply be a ‘rolling ball-type’ machine 

11. Those at the beginning and end of the cycle should try to engineer a meaningful overture (opening) and denouement (climax)

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

The outcomes of this project contribute to your achievement of the Unit learning outcomes and form the basis of the assessment of your work. The learning outcomes for this project are highlighted as follows:

1. Critical engagement with a range of research methods and theory relevant to your practice; 

2. Ability to synthesise your research into design proposals that take into account different scenarios or contexts of application; 

3. Effective communication of a variety of proposals in different areas of the discipline to a range of audiences; (Technical competence) and (Communication and Presentation) 

4. Critical awareness of your own personal and professional strengths and weaknesses. 5. Ability to manage the roles and r
