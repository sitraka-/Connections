## BACKGROUND

> The details are not the details, they make the product, just as details make the architecture — the gauge of the wire, the selection of the wood, the finish of the castings — the connections, the connections, the connections.

Charles Eames quoted in Massey, A., _Interior Design of the 20th Century_, New York, Thames and Hudson, 1990, 145–62.

When [Charles Eames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eames) said the above, he was alluding to the relationship between elements of design detailing in a piece of office furniture. On a bigger scale, he meant this as a metaphor for the process of design as a whole. 

The concept of **_connections_** is closely related to common theories of **_creativity_**, and is fundamental to the production of design work in particular. 

Design as a process is very much concerned with the location, formation or exploitation of connections. Connections between what? Connections between disciplines such as design and architecture, music and performance, philosophy and physics; connections between objects; connections between departments; connections between institutions; connections between people and machines; connections between markets and consumers; connections between individuals and environments, subjects and objects. 

The connections between individuals on a course such as MAID is one of the primary defining characteristics of your learning experience. Coming from such a vast range of backgrounds and cultures, you have much to learn from each other. In undertaking this project, you will create symbolic links between individuals that will come to represent your group in dynamic terms. 

The project is intended to get you to work together as a team to create something that represents your MAID cohort. But importantly, connections also function as an introduction to the workshops, where you will work with the technical staff who you will engage throughout the course. The project will make you familiar with the workshop working practices and the materials and processes available to you.

## BRIEF

You will be divided into groups, with each group assigned a number and an action verbs to choose from the list below. The chain reaction will commence with Group 1, as they create a mechanism to trigger a second device crafted by Group 2, all while embodying and expressing the selected action verb. The sequence continues with Group 3 and beyond until the final member of the chain. The task involves crafting the mechanism using materials and processes available within the college workshops.

### List of action verbs:

1. Tear
2. Shove
3. Push
4. Pull
5. Tug
6. Nudge
7. Grasp
8. Jostle
9. Graze
10. Pinch
11. Squeeze
12. Fling
13. Toss
14. Throw
15. Kick
16. Spin
17. Spin around
18. Twirl
19. Flip
1. Tumble
1. Flip over
1. Roll
1. Roll over
1. Slide
1. Bounce
1. Tumble down
1. Knock
1. Tap
1. Slam shut
1. Smash
1. Crush
1. Drop
1. Topple
1. Collapse
1. Swing
1. Strike
1. Punch
1. Collide
1. Hit
1. Ram

## PRODUCTION RULES

1. Keep it simple, test it, test it and test it!
2. The overall effect should be a dynamic, kinetic sculpture that represents not only you as individuals, but also as a group 
3. It is your responsibility to liaise with the person before and the person after to achieve the required transition between each piece 
5. Each object acts as a potential energy storage (e.g., via a spring, elastic band, or gravity), and should need only a slight force for release to trigger the next object.
6. This is not an art project as such. Your mechanism should be robust, easily re-settable, well designed, and well made. 
7. Your design may not involve petrochemicals, liquids, fire, gas or explosives. Sorry! 
<!-- 8. The most effective sections have some kind of delay mechanism that creates a pause and creates tension. The key is to engineer the right length of delay -->
7. Use stuff found in the workshop, around the studio for their practical properties as well as the meanings that they may convey.
10. Your piece should not simply be a ‘rolling ball-type’ machine, but should embody the verb of action you have chosen 
11. Those at the beginning and end of the cycle should try to engineer a meaningful overture (opening) and denouement (climax)
1. Keep it simple, test it, test it and test it! 

## DELIVERABLES

- A single mechanised chain reaction, successfully integrating all groups individual contributions.
- The completed piece should be able to fit on a __*FLAT*__ surface (i.e. the studio
floor, no changes in height between separate elements, unless the elements are built that way).
- The contraptions should transfer energy in the __*SAME DIRECTION*__.
- The contraptions should be easily and quickly re-settable.
- Each mechanism must have a reasonable footprint.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

The outcomes of this project contribute to your achievement of the Unit learning outcomes and form the basis of the assessment of your work. The learning outcomes for this project are highlighted as follows:

1. Critical engagement with a range of research methods and theory relevant to your practice; 
2. Ability to synthesise your research into design proposals that take into account different scenarios or contexts of application; 
3. Effective communication of a variety of proposals in different areas of the discipline to a range of audiences; (Technical competence) and (Communication and Presentation) 
4. Critical awareness of your own personal and professional strengths and weaknesses; 
5. Ability to manage the roles and responsibilities of yourself and others as part of an effective team;
